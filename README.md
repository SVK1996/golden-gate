## Introduction

This is the README file for the E-commerce Backend Application. The application serves as the backend for an e-commerce platform, providing functionalities like product management, user authentication, shopping cart management, and order processing.

## Setup and Run

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11.5 installed on your system.
   - Install PostgreSQL and Redis servers if not already installed.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection settings in the `env_config.py` file.

3. **Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment for the application to manage dependencies and isolate them from the system-wide Python environment.
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Database Setup:**
   - Run the database migration sql scripts manually in terminal from `/db/migrations` to create the necessary tables and schemas.

7. **Start the Application:**
   - Start the application server:
     ```
     python3 app.py
     ```

8. **Access the API:**
   - The application will be running locally, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Enhancements

6. **User Profiles:** Allow users to create and manage profiles, including shipping addresses and payment methods.

7. **Communication:** Integrate a communication system for users to contact customer support, implement real-time messaging or email notifications for important updates.

8. **Invoice:** Develop an invoice generation system for order transactions , generate invoices in PDF or other common formats and email them to customers.

### System Enhancements

1. **Security:** Enhance security by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for users and revoking of token during logout.

2. **Scalability:** Optimize database queries by using indexing as well as use of open source tools such as elastic search , read replication strategies, load balancing techniques to handle increased traffic interms of scalability.

3. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring system to track application performance and errors with use of opensource tools such as prometheus and grafana.

4. **Database Utilities:** use of schema migration Libraries for executing DDL , ORM for dynamicity.



Feel free to explore and implement these enhancements to improve the functionality and performance of the E-commerce Backend Application.
