## Introduction

This is the README file for the E-commerce Backend Application. The application serves as the backend for an e-commerce platform, providing functionalities like product management, user authentication, shopping cart management, and order processing.

## Setup and Run

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11.5 installed on your system.
   - Install PostgreSQL and Redis servers if not already installed.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database connection settings in the `env_config.py` file.

3. **Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment for the application to manage dependencies and isolate them from the system-wide Python environment.
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Database Setup:**
   - Run the database migration sql scripts manually in terminal from `/db/migrations` to create the necessary tables and schemas.

7. **Start the Application:**
   - Start the application server:
     ```
     python3 app.py
     ```

8. **Access the API:**
   - The application will be running locally, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Enhancements

### Product Enhancements

1. **Product Categories:** Implement a product categorization system to organize products into categories for easier navigation.

2. **Search and Recommendation:** Add search and filtering options to help users find products more efficiently and also recommendation features based on user behavior and preferences.

3. **Product Reviews:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products.

4. **Payment Integration:** Integrate payment gateways to enable secure and convenient payment processing for orders.

5. **Delivery Tracking:** Implement delivery tracking and status updates for users to monitor their order progress.

6. **User Profiles:** Allow users to create and manage profiles, including shipping addresses and payment methods.

7. **Communication:** Integrate a communication system for users to contact customer support, implement real-time messaging or email notifications for important updates.

8. **Invoice:** Develop an invoice generation system for order transactions , generate invoices in PDF or other common formats and email them to customers.

### System Enhancements

1. **Security:** Enhance security by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for users and revoking of token during logout.

2. **Scalability:** 
Implementation of efficient indexing techniques to optimize database queries,
Integration of open-source tools like Elasticsearch to enhance search capabilities,
Implementation of read replication strategies to distribute read traffic efficiently,
Adoption of load balancing techniques to handle increased user traffic for improved scalability and performance.

3. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring system to track application performance and errors with use of opensource tools such as prometheus and grafana.

4. **Database Manageement and Optimization:** Employ schema migration libraries for executing Data Definition Language (DDL) operations and utilize Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for enhanced flexibility and dynamism in database interactions.

Feel free to explore and implement these enhancements to improve the functionality and performance of the E-commerce Backend Application.
